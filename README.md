# Tutu Bot

Tutu Bot is a modular Discord bot designed to streamline community management for a single guild. It provides a comprehensive suite of features for events, permissions, roles, support, moderation, and moreâ€”all accessible via modern Discord slash commands and interactive UI components.

## Purpose & Philosophy

Tutu Bot aims to:
- Simplify server management for admins, mods, and users alike.
- Centralize all core community features in one bot, reducing clutter.
- Use Discord's latest UI (buttons, selects, modals) for a seamless, argument-free experience.
- Enforce clear, consistent, and visually appealing embedded responses for all interactions.

- All commands use Discord UI components instead of optional arguments.
- Admin/owner-only commands are permission-protected.

## Interaction & Response Style

- **All responses are embedded messages** with a required header emoji (e.g., âœ“ for success, âœ— for error, ðŸ“š for info).
- Uses â€¢ for bullet points in embed descriptions and fields.
- Buttons use ButtonStyle.secondary except destructive actions (ButtonStyle.danger).
- Users are mentioned with @ (using `.mention`) even in ephemeral messages.
- Errors are handled with informative embeds, following tutu-rules for emoji and formatting.
- Test commands use the `!` prefix and are not registered as slash commands.
